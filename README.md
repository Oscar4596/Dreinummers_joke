# Dreinummers_joke

The old german friend of the scientist, left him an important message in the code. 
But ohhh... The clue Dockerfile is wet and some letters are gone.
Dreinummer says that this poem can help us fix it:

_Mr. Dreinummer can set us free_

_I want the message. one, two, three_

_To solve this, fix the Dockerfile_

_And you'll have to do it with style_

####

_mingo, proudly is the first one_

_dedalus the second will be_

_An entrance to the hub they have won_

_With the Image they will flee_

####

_Dreinummer wrote this code_

_but the envars... he forgot_
