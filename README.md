# Dreinummers_joke

The old german friend of the scientist, left him an important message in the code. 
But ohhh... The clue Dockerfile is wet and some letters are gone.
Dreinummer says that this poem can help us fix it:

*Mr. Dreinummer can set us free
I want the message. one, two, three
To solve this, fix the Dockerfile
And you'll have to do it with style

mingo, proudly is the first one
dedalus the second will be
An entrance to the hub they have won
With the Image they will flee

Dreinummer wrote this code
but the envars... he forgot*
