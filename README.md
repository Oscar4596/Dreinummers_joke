# Dreinummers_joke

The old german friend of the scientist, left him an important message in the code. 
But ohhh... The clue is wet and some letters are gone.
Dreinummer says that this poem can help us fix it:

_Mr. Dreinummer can set us free_

_I want the message. one, two, three_

_To solve this, fix the Dockerfile_

_And you'll have to do it with style_

####

_mingo, proudly is the first one_

_dedalus the second will be_

_An entrance to the hub they have won_

_With the Image they will flee_

####

_You source to go is the language to go_

_And this source is alpine for sure_

_But if you're not of the amd gang_

_You better look for yours in a bang_

####

_Dreinummer wrote this code_

_but the envars... he forgot_

_Don't forget to compile_

_Otherwise you won't fly_

I always remember the sweet words from Professor Dreinummer. he always said 'You don't need docker to solve my joke'
